Fully reengineered RUET’s legacy result management system into a modern, scalable web platform using Next.js and PostgreSQL — built from the ground up to handle everything from student enrollment to automated SGPA/CGPA calculation.

⚙️ Key Features:
🔐 Admin portal to manage students, departments, courses, and publish results. Admin also has the ability to manually register/unregister courses students & promoting them to next semester!
📚 Student portal with course registration and CGPA tracking
📈 Automated SGPA/CGPA calculation (credit-weighted, grade-letter mapped)

And yes, it’s fully functional. Real dashboards. Real data. Real features.
Link in the comments! Give it a try!
🧪 Admin credentials:
Username: admin
Password: admin123
(For demo purposes only — not yet in real use, but absolutely usable with minor credential/config tweaks)

🛠️ Tech Used:
✅ Next.js 15 + App Router
✅ PostgreSQL (Neon)
✅ Session-based auth with secure cookies
✅ Middleware for route protection
✅ Role-Based Access Control (Admin/Student)
✅ Responsive UI (CSS Modules + custom shadcn/ui-style components)
✅ Deployed on a serverless platform (Vercel)

This isn’t just another CRUD app — it’s a full-stack academic engine tailored for real institutional needs, built for performance, accuracy, and ease of use.

Nexus Future Fund (Investment Platform)
Nexus Future Fund (Investment Platform)
Oct 2024 - Jan 2025Oct 2024 - Jan 2025
Nexus Future Fund is a cutting-edge, crypto-based hedge fund platform designed to deliver high monthly return of investment through risk-managed, algorithmic trading. I led the full-stack development of the platform, which combines Next.js, Appwrite, PWA, Discord BOT, TypeScript and a custom `internal` trade automation system with Python, MQL5 in MetaTrader, VPS hosting to provide a secure, transparent, and high-performing investment experience.

Key features include:
✅ Secure user dashboards with wallet tracking, performance analytics etc.
✅ Full PWA support with installability and offline capabilities.
✅ Appwrite-based backend for auth and DB.
✅ Multi-tiered route system for blogs, guides, policies, and onboarding flow.
✅ Real-time trade replication for 50+ MT5 slave accounts. (private codebase)
✅ Enterprise-grade code structuring, versioning, and environment isolation.

This project not only addresses retail investor pain points around crypto volatility, but also sets a new benchmark in crypto fund transparency and reliability.

This app has been in the making for over a month & still going...
The main moto of the app is to reduce the tedious process of evaluating OMR Sheets by hand which is time consuming & might lead to some wrong evaluations. And using a machine is very costly. Also, the report making process is time killing as well.
But this app can do all these in couple of minutes with few clicks of buttons.
How?

Well, it has 3 core features:
✅ Creating customizable OMR Sheets (the OMR PDF can be printed for examination)
✅ Evaluating those papers with mobile camera in a short amount of time using computer vision
✅ Generating customizable report of all evaluated students (available as a PDF or send it to teacher's email as a .csv file)

But there are many minor features as well, like
✅ If somehow user deletes the PDFs made by the app (mistakenly or to free up storage), then the app can re-generate those PDFs automatically with 1 click of a button.
✅ If a student mistakenly filled wrong ID number / set, then teacher can manually fix that inside the app.
✅ There are lots of analysis, like individual student analysis, overall exam analysis. 
✅ Searching, filtering by name/ID/set etc.

Watch the attached video to see it in action!
Ummmm, with all these, now it's not even a OMR (Optical Mark Recognition) anymore, right? I think we should call It AMR (Artificial Mark Recognition). JK! But the app has limitations, which I'll try to improve time to time.

Anyways, in the last couple of months, I've explored a lot about the android Operating System, Computer Vision & Cross-Platform Apps.
It's still under development and I'm continuously learning & researching new things & hoping to make OMRElite better 💜.
