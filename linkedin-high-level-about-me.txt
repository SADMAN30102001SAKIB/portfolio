👨‍💻 Got a little bored one weekend…
So I casually reengineered RUET’s entire result management system from scratch. You know, for fun.
What started as a hobby project turned into a full-blown academic engine (around 20K lines of code, by the way!)

⚙️ Key Features:
🔐 Admin portal to manage students, departments, courses, and publish results. Admin also has the ability to manually register/unregister courses students & promoting them to next semester!
📚 Student portal with course registration and CGPA tracking
📈 Automated SGPA/CGPA calculation (credit-weighted, grade-letter mapped)

And yes, it’s fully functional. Real dashboards. Real data. Real features.
Link in the comments! Give it a try!
🧪 Admin credentials:
Username: admin
Password: admin123
(For demo purposes only — not yet in real use, but absolutely usable with minor credential/config tweaks)

🛠️ Tech Used:
✅ Next.js 15 + App Router
✅ PostgreSQL (Neon)
✅ Session-based auth with secure cookies
✅ Middleware for route protection
✅ Role-Based Access Control (Admin/Student)
✅ Responsive UI (CSS Modules + custom shadcn/ui-like components)
✅ Deployed on a serverless platform (Vercel)

Built it. Tested it. Deployed it. Done. ✅

And — it turned out way more useful than I expected. Might even be used by real institutions in future👀? LOL
No fancy libraries or frameworks (aside from Next.js, which I genuinely enjoy 😜).
No overengineering. Just practical code solving a real-world problem.
Kept things as raw and minimal as possible (for example, used CSS Modules instead of Tailwind, just for that hands-on feel)

Nexus Future Fund - Guaranteed 24%+ Yearly Return | Safe InvestmentsNexus Future Fund - Guaranteed 24%+ Yearly Return | Safe Investments
Nexus Future FundNexus Future Fund
Nexus Future Fund is a crypto-based hedge fund platform designed to deliver high monthly ROI through risk-managed, algorithmic trading. I led the full-stack development of the platform, which combines Next.js, Appwrite, and a custom `internal` trade automation system to provide a secure, and high-performing investment experience.

This project not only addresses retail investor pain points around crypto volatility, but also sets a new benchmark in crypto fund transparency and reliability.Nexus Future Fund is a crypto-based hedge fund platform designed to deliver high monthly ROI through risk-managed, algorithmic trading.

OMRElite: Computer Vision Mobile App for Evaluating OMR/Bubble Sheet Based Exams

After almost 10K+ lines of code, countless sleepless nights, infinite amount of bug/error fixing later, Introducing "OMRElite"!

The app has been in the making for over a month & still going...
The main moto of the app is to reduce the tedious process of evaluating OMR Sheets by hand which is time consuming & might lead to some wrong evaluations. And using a machine is very costly. Also, the report making process is time killing as well.
But this app can do all these in couple of minutes with few clicks of buttons.
How?

Well, it has 3 core features:
I) Creating customizable OMR Sheets (the OMR PDF can be printed for examination)
II) Evaluating those papers with mobile camera in a short amount of time using computer vision
III) Generating customizable report of all evaluated students (available as a PDF or send it to teacher's email as a .csv file)

Check The Attached Video (link in comments)!

But there are many minor features as well, like
* If somehow user deletes the PDFs made by the app (mistakenly or to free up storage), then the app can re-generate those PDFs automatically with 1 click of a button.
* If a student mistakenly filled wrong ID number / set, then teacher can manually fix that inside the app.
* There are lots of analysis, like individual student analysis, overall exam analysis. 
* Searching, filtering by name/ID/set etc.

Ummmm, with all these, now it's not even a OMR (Optical Mark Recognition) anymore, right? I think we should call It AMR (Artificial Mark Recognition). JK! But the app has limitations, which I'll try to improve time to time.

All right, now future goals for OMRElite
Major:
1) Integration Database for creating accounts so that users can log in to any device with their credentials & all their previous work will be visible.
2) Create a mechanism for joining students via a "joining code", so that students can join with that "code" & view their own evaluated OMR & overall report.
3) Currently the user has to manually click on capture to get the image. so will try to automate it such a way that the app auto captures the OMR page as soon as the camera detects the page. 
4) Creating a Web Version of the app

Minor:
1) Implement a "recycle bin" feature to safely store deleted exams or student data before permanent deletion.
2) Reduce network latency & improve app performance.
3) Improve the OMR & App designs.
Anyways, in the last couple of months, I've explored a lot about the android Operating System, Computer Vision & Cross-Platform Apps.
It's still under development and I'm continuously learning & researching new things & hoping to make OMRElite better 💜.

It's an WebApp that solves ordinary differential equations (general + particular solutions) just by writing the ODE. 
Tech Stack: Katex (Latex library for displaying math expressions in browser) from Javascript, Flask & SymPy (symbolic python library that solves the ODE) from python, but I had to manually perform a hell lot of string manipulation to make the entered ODE suitable for sympy!It's an WebApp that solves ordinary differential equations (general + particular solutions) just by writing the ODE.

🚀Roaming in Computer Vision 🚀

I’m excited to share the first stage of my learning path in Computer Vision!

 📷 Over the past semester, I’ve been diving into the fundamentals, starting from basic image processing techniques to more advanced topics. It’s been a thrilling experience, and I’m just getting started! See on: https://lnkd.in/gfFeYTRp

🎯 Project Highlight: One of my key projects is building a system to scan and evaluate OMR (Optical Mark Recognition) sheets. As of now, the project deals with scanning and evaluation of OMRs and it is still in progress, and I plan to integrate a Deep Learning model to accurately detect handwritten roll numbers. See on: https://lnkd.in/gNuzU535

🗓️ Moving forward, I’ll be posting updates on my learning journey every two weeks—sharing insights, new learnings, and hands-on projects I'll be working on.

A special mention to my friend, Sadman Sakib, who has taken the OMR project to the next level by developing a mobile app! He’s done an incredible job, and I highly encourage my connections to check out his work. Currently his app in on beta version.
You can explore the details of his project here: https://lnkd.in/guSFmN9P


Here’s a quick video of the OMR scanning and evaluation in action! 📽
